# CO600 Project

My CO600 Project. Creating a CLI-based calendar program that syncs and integrates with cloud services like Google Calendar.

## Project Aims:
- accurately records dates and can schedule/list/delete events
- Easy to use, simple commands
- Google Calendar Integration

## How to use:
run install.sh
calcli bash file should be on your path, if not add ~/.local/bin to your path

## Google Calendar:
run calcli -g

You will be prompted to log in ONCE in a browser and then the token should be stored on your machinef or 7 days. Until google approve the app you will have to re-login occasionally.
