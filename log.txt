[12.10.21   12:51] Google API and Virtualenv
                --> Virtualenv auto creates a .gitignore file that prevents it being commited
                    had trouble and found a solution here: https://libzx.so/main/learning/2016/03/13/best-practice-for-virtualenv-and-git-repos.html
                --> Set up google developer account, added details to bitwarden
                --> created test even on 15.10.21 for use with my calendar event
